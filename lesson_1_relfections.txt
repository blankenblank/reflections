The diff between two versions allowed me to quickly find what I had changed from the version that I was working on and the older version without spending a lot of time going through and looking at each individual line of code. It was very useful.
EVery time a change is made make sure to save a new version
The pros would be that you have control over when to commit
the cons would be that sometimes you don't commit enough
Repository- multiple files that you want to track together
-- stat gives information about all the files that have changed in a commit
Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because it is designed to help programmers working with multiple files keep track of the changes they have made for easy debugging
git log allows you to see the commits and the labels for each
git diff allows you to see lines that have been added or removed in red or green respectively
git checkout allows you to run a previous commit to see if it has the same error as the current commit
Using version control would make you more confident because you are able to easily revert to an older state if you make a mistake
